                            Welcome to the <span>Priam's Animal Foundation,</span> a leading animal shelter and low-cost vet clinic dedicated to saving the lives of animals in the Baguio City, Philippines 
                            . Since our founding in 2024, we have been committed to our mission of saving all healthy and treatable animals in our community. 
                            Last year alone, we were able to save over 2,000 lost, homeless, and mistreated animals.

                        <h1>Our Mission</h1>
                        At the <span>Priam's Animal Foundation,</span> our primary goal is to provide a safe haven for animals in need and find them loving forever homes 
                        . We believe that every animal deserves a chance at a happy and fulfilling life, and we work tirelessly to make that a reality. Through our adoption programs, 
                        we strive to match animals with caring individuals and families who will provide them with the love and care they deserve.
